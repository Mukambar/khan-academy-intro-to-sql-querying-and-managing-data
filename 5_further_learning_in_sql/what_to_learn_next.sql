/*What to learn next
Google Classroom
Congratulations on learning SQL!
Now that you've learned all that, 
here are some ideas for how to keep going.

Try SQL in other environments
On Khan Academy, we created a playground for you to 
try out SQL with small amounts of fake data. We encourage 
you to keep experimenting with it here, but you'll likely want 
to use your skills in an environment with real data.

Try SQL for data analysis. 
These days, SQL is often used to analyze data that comes from all 
sorts of places. One way that you can start analyzing data immediately
is with Google's BigQuery, which includes a SQL-like language, and 
lets you upload data or use public data sets. Learn more from the
BigQuery documentation.

Try SQL on the server-side. 
QL can be used to manage the data in an app's server-side database.
A user uses the app via the "frontend" (webpage or mobile app), 
the frontend sends HTTP requests to the "backend" (server), and
the backend issues SQL commands to the database. You can set up 
a server-side app on your own computer using many different 
languages/frameworks, two popular stacks are LAMP and LAPP.

Try SQL in a webpage. 
If you don't have a server setup or data to analyze, you 
could use SQLite inside a webpage, to store data that the 
user creates while using the webpage. The data won't be 
stored when the user leaves the page, however. You can 
spin-off this example of using SQLite in a webpage.

Learn more SQL
We covered a lot of SQL, but as you use it more, particularly for 
creating read/write databases to power apps, you should familiarize 
yourself with all the features available. You can learn more about 
indexes and query planning, constraints, triggers, views, and foreign 
keys. It's best if you know which SQL environment you'll be using those 
features in first, so you can read the most accurate documentation for it.
You could also learn different versions of SQL that are used with popular
database vendors, like MySQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL, and DB2, 
perhaps in combination with learning SQL on the server-side.
Go deeper on databases
SQL is a way to interact with databases, so by learning SQL, you've 
also learned a fair bit about how databases work. However, you can go 
much deeper in the area of databases - learning more about the theories, 
principles, and design - like relational design theory, relational algebra 
and unified modeling language. One way to learn those is with Stanford's 
self-paced Intro to Databases class.*/
